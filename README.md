This app is built using native JavaScript. A set of random numbers between a min and max
is generated and sorted. Using the Chart.js library we can visualize this data in multiple forms.
The application does not need to be run on a server.

The current sorting algorithms supported are: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.
All algorithms are programmed within sort.js.
